            <h3>Number Systems</h3>
            <p>A number system is a structured method of expressing and working with numerical
                 values. Each system is defined by a set of symbols (digits) and a base, 
                 which determines how numbers are grouped and calculated. Number systems 
                 are essential for understanding mathematical concepts and are applied in 
                 areas like computing, science, and engineering. It is a mathematical 
                 framework for representing and working with numbers. It provides a set 
                 of symbols and rules for writing and manipulating numbers in a consistent 
                 and logical way. Number systems are used across various domains such as 
                 mathematics, computing, and everyday life.</p>
                 <h4>Types of Number Systems</h4>
                <div class="decimal">
                    <p>1. Decimal (Base-10):
                        <br/>Description: This system, familiar in everyday life, uses ten digits ranging from 0 to 9. The position of each digit signifies its value, multiplied by increasing powers of 10 from right to left. Decimal numbers may include whole numbers, fractions, or decimals (e.g., 42 or 3.14). It’s the default system for most manual calculations and human activities like counting and measuring.
                        <br/>Symbols: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9.
                        <br/>Base: 10 (uses ten unique symbols).
                        <br/>Example: 345, 7.89.
                        <br/>Applications: Used in finance, measurements, and general arithmetic
                        </p>
                </div>
                <br/>
                <div class="binary">
                    <p>2. Binary (Base-2):
                        <br/>Description: The binary system relies on only two digits, 0 and 1, making it ideal for electronic devices and computer systems, which interpret these values as off (0) and on (1) states.  Used primarily in digital systems and computing.
                        <br/>Symbols: 0, 1.
                        <br/>Base: 2 (uses two unique symbols).
                        <br/>Example: 1011 (binary representation of 11 in decimal).
                        <br/>Applications: Data processing, computer programming, and electronics.
                    </p>
                </div>
                <br/>
                <div class="octal">
                    <p>3. Octal (Base-8):
                        <br/>Description: Less commonly used, but found in some computing systems. In this system, numbers are expressed using digits from 0 to 7. Each place in an octal number corresponds to a power of 8. Octal was historically used in computing for its simplicity in converting to and from binary, where three binary digits map directly to one octal digit.
                        <br/>Symbols: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7.
                       <br/>Base: 8 (uses eight unique symbols).
                       <br/>Example: 17 (octal representation of 15 in decimal).
                       <br/> Applications: Shortcut for representing binary data in programming.
                    </p>
                </div>
                <br/>
                <div class="hexadecimal">
                    <p>4. Hexadecimal (Base-16):
                        <br/>Description: Widely used in computer programming and digital systems for its compact representation of binary data. This system extends the decimal concept by introducing six additional symbols: A, B, C, D, E, and F, which represent the values 10 through 15. Each position represents a power of 16, making it very efficient for representing large binary numbers compactly.
                        <br/>Symbols: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, A, B, C, D, E, F (where A-F represent 10-15).
                        <br/>Base: 16 (uses sixteen unique symbols).
                        <br/>Example: 1F (hexadecimal representation of 31 in decimal).
                        <br/>Applications: Memory addressing, color codes in web design (e.g., #FF5733), and digital systems.
                    </p>
                </div>
                <br/>
                <div class="roman-numbers">
                    <p>5. Roman Numerals:
                        <br/>Description: A numeral system originating in ancient Rome, not positional and lacks a base.
                        <br/>Symbols: I, V, X, L, C, D, M.
                        <br/>Base: None (additive and subtractive rules are used).
                        <br/>Example: XII (represents 12 in decimal).
                        <br/>Applications: Used in historical contexts, clocks, and book chaptering.
                    </p>
                </div>
                <br/>
                <div class="others">
                    <p>6. Other Number Systems:
                        <br/>Ternary (Base-3): Rarely used but applied in certain theoretical computing concepts. Uses digits 0, 1, and 2; found in some niche applications like theoretical computing.
                        <br/>Duodecimal (Base-12): Sometimes proposed for practical use due to divisibility. Sometimes suggested for its divisibility advantages (e.g., 12 divides evenly by 2, 3, 4, and 6).
                        <br/>Quinary (Base-5): Historically used by some cultures, such as the Mayan numeral system.                       
                    </p>
                </div>
                <br/>
                <div class="core-concept">
                    <p> <h4>Core Concepts in Number Systems</h4>
                        <br/>1.	Base (Radix): Defines the total number of unique digits available. For example, the decimal system (base 10) has ten symbols.
                        <br/>2.	Positional Value: In positional notation, a digit’s value depends on its position in the number. For example, in 324324324, the digit 3 is in the hundreds place, giving it a value of 3×1003 \times 1003×100.
                        <br/>3.	Conversions: Numbers can be converted between systems, such as converting binary to decimal or hexadecimal to octal, often by breaking the number into manageable parts or using standard formulas.
                        <br/>4.	Arithmetic Operations: Addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division can be performed within any number system, though the methods may vary slightly based on the base.
                        <br/>5.	Applications: Different systems have unique strengths, making them suitable for specific tasks:
                        <br/><<ul>
                            <li>Decimal: Everyday human use.</li>
                            <li>Binary: Computing and digital electronics.</li>
                            <li>Hexadecimal: Memory addressing and color coding.</li>
                            <li>Octal: Legacy systems in computing</li>
                          </ul>
                    </p>
                </div>
                <br/>
                <div class="historical">
                    <p><h4>Historical and Cultural Perspectives </h4>
                    Number systems have evolved across civilizations. For example:
                        <<ul>
                            <li>The Babylonians used a base-60 system, which influences how we measure time and angles.</li>
                            <li>The Mayans developed a base-20 system, evident in their calendar calculations.</li>
                            <li>Roman numerals, though non-positional, remain a cultural legacy in numbering chapters or events.</li>
                          </ul>
